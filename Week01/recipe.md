### _By Esther Hur_

> **Ingredients:**

- **Organic matcha powder** ('Wild Orchard' brand recommended)
- Brewed and leftover **tea leaves** (better damp)
- Dash of hot (but not boiling) **water**
- **Milk** of choice (Organic grass-fed whole milk recommended)
- **Organic maple syrup**

> **Let's barista it up:**

1. Scoop a small spoonful of matcha powder into a cup and whisk together with a dash of hot water until no chunks and foamy
2. In the blender, blend together two big spoons of brewed tea leaves, matcha blend, 2 cups of milk, and 2-3 tablespoons of maple syrup
3. Pour blended drink into two cups of ice
4. Reflect on your life as you sip on this health in a cup

Makes two servings - because good things should be shared :)
