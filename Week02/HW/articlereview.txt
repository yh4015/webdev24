by Esther Hur

Wireframing is one of the most efficient tools in driving both conversation and ideas.

The 5 important considerations for wireframing:
1. Clarify the problem -> before planning a solution, gain clarity about the issues in the problem.
2. Workflow and sketches -> sketching the workflow can generate critical questions and streamline the user experience process.
3. Get feedback (early) -> more people's wisdom and insight, the more perspectives and capabilities that can mitigate problems and limitations.
4. Know your tools -> time is energy. time is essential. get to know your tools, get comfortable with it, and save energy for creatively solving the problem.
5. Know your audience -> the fidelity of wireframes should be tailored to the audience; match their needs and vibes.

Thus: Considering these points can help you to better focus on wireframing which leads to a better solution which leads to a happy team.
